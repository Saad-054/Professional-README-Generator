## Description
My motivation for creating the JavaScript code for the Console-Finances task was to analyze a dataset containing financial records with Date and Profit/Losses fields. By writing this code, I aimed to calculate various important financial metrics to gain insights into the dataset.

The task involved calculating the total number of months in the dataset, finding the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, and determining the average of the changes in Profit/Losses throughout the dataset. I was also required to track the monthly changes in profits and find the average change using this information.

Additionally, I was determined to identify the greatest increase in profits (with the corresponding date) and the greatest decrease in losses (also with the corresponding date) over the entire period of financial data.

By undertaking this challenge and creating the JavaScript code, I sought to demonstrate my proficiency in handling financial data and applying analytical skills using JavaScript. I also aimed to provide an organized and insightful analysis, displaying the results in a clear and user-friendly manner within the browser, similar to the example provided in the task description. Overall, my motivation was to showcase my ability to extract valuable financial insights from a dataset and present them effectively through JavaScript programming.
